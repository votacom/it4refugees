/**
 * Write a function that takes an array of numbers and a number as input parameters,
 * and returns the index of the next greater number.
 *
 * For example, for the array [1,4,3,2,5,7] and the number 4, the function should
 * return 4 (the index of the next greater number, 5). Consequently, for the same
 * array and the number 5, the function should return 6 (the index of 7).
 *
 * If you want, you can also write another function that returns the "distance"
 * to the next index, that is, how many indices after the given number the next
 * greater number is stored. For the examples above, for input 4, the function
 * should return 3, for input 5, the function should return 1.
