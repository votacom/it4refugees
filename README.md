## Dez 7:
Recap of variable scoping (Quiz)
ArrayList as an alternative to Array which makes life easier
Correction of a "bad" implementation with arrays to a good one using ArrayList

Homework: two exercises in homework.pdf

## Dez 5:
Recap of Object Oriented Programming
Examples for using the "Generate" option in IntelliJ for Constructor, Setter and Getters and the toString() method
Arrays of self implemented classes

Homework: See the homework.pdf in the folder lecture 05.12 -> until Dec 12

## Nov 30:
Object Oriented Programming: Constructors, Visibility, Setter&Getter

The homework exercises until next week (Dec 7) are in the particular folder.

## Nov 28:
Array recap, discussing scope of variables.
Indroduction to object-oriented programming with simple examples.

### Homework:
Completing the examples written during lesson (adding toString() and setter - Methods).

## Nov 23:
Function and Array Recap.
Together, we wrote a program which prints words in a frame. A reference implementation can be found in lecture 23.11./presentation/frame.
The solution we worked out together on the blackboard and the beamer can be found in lecture 23.11./frame_group-solution.

### Homework
There are four exercises as homework, you can find them in the lecture 23.11./exercises directory.

## Nov 21:
After recap we will learn Scanner and 2D-Arrays.

### Homework
We made a 4 in a row example template.
You can also find more exercises on http://codingbat.com/java

## Nov 16:
String manipulation was repeated and further examples have been explained. Further more we covered Arrays, how to init, fill with data and print them.

###Homework
The Homework consists of multiple exercises about arrays. The last exercise is optional and covers multi dimensional arrays.

## Nov 14:
We started with String manipulations. The functions length, contains, startsWith, endsWith, indexOf and charAt were explained.

###Homework is optional 

The method definitions are in the file Homework.java in the lecture directory. 

## Nov 9:
We revisited loops and functions.

You can find the Diamond example in the respective directory.

###Homework until 16.11.2016:

In the lectures directory there is a Project calles exercises.
It contains the homework about functions until 16.11.2016.


Some of the exercises were taken from http://www.programmingbydoing.com. 
There you can find many other useful exercises!

## Oct 19:
We have learned if-else-statements and while- and for-loops.
We have learned the data type <code>double</code> and the keyword <code>final</code>.

Here, you will find:
* Cheatsheet.pdf - an overview of how the Java constructs we have learned so far work
* exercises.pdf - a collection of exercises you can do, but do not have to do
* homework.pdf - this sheet contains the homework assignemnts. (note that there is some additional homework below)
* Presentation.pdf - the presentation slides of today
* IntelliJ-Project - a directory that is an IntelliJ project containing all the programs we have presented in today's lecture. Plus, it contains the program named "Preview" that shows you what you will learn next lecture.
* IntelliJ-Project.zip - the same, but in a single zip-file so that you can download it more easily

Additional homework:
* do the exercise on the for-loop from the presentation slides (slide number 11 of 12)
* try out the program named "Preview" from the IntelliJ project to see what you can do after the next lecture.

## Oct 17:

We have learned what are variables, how to declare and initialize them, what is a constant, the arithmetic operators and the string concatenation operator.

The presentationc slides are available in the respective directory.
