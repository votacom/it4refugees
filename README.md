# Welcome.TU.code

Materials for TU Wien's programming lectures for Welcome.TU.code in the winter term 2016/17

## Oct 19:
We have learned if-else-statements and while- and for-loops.
We have learned the data type <code>double</code> and the keyword <code>final</code>.

Here, you will find:
* Cheatsheet.pdf - an overview of how the Java constructs we have learned so far work
* exercises.pdf - a collection of exercises you can do, but do not have to do
* homework.pdf - this sheet contains the homework assignemnts. (note that there is some additional homework below)
* Presentation.pdf - the presentation slides of today
* IntelliJ-Project - a directory that is an IntelliJ project containing all the programs we have presented in today's lecture. Plus, it contains the program named "Preview" that shows you what you will learn next lecture.
* IntelliJ-Project.zip - the same, but in a single zip-file so that you can download it more easily

Additional homework:
* do the exercise on the for-loop from the presentation slides (slide number 11 of 12)
* try out the program named "Preview" from the IntelliJ project to see what you can do after the next lecture.

## Oct 17:

We have learned what are variables, how to declare and initialize them, what is a constant, the arithmetic operators and the string concatenation operator.

The presentationc slides are available in the respective directory.
